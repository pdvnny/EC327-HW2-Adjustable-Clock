## Short Description

This was an assignment for an introduction to software engineering course. I was tasked with creating a clock graphic that could be run and adjusted from a Unix terminal.

## Purpose of the Repo

This repo was developed for a class. It is intended for practice only.

## How to recreate and run the program...

*information coming soon*

## Long Description

This repo contains scripts related to an assignment for EC 327 - Introduction to Software Engineering at Boston University. 

My assignment was to create a clock graphic using the Simple and Fast Multimedia Library ([SFML](https://www.sfml-dev.org/)).

Important requirements of the product:
- The graphic must contain a digital print out and analog clock (with hour, minute, and second hands).
- The graphic digital clock display and an ASCII date print out to a terminal must only happen once every second. This print out must occur in the first quarter of each second.
- The assignment also required that the user be able to enter an a time (in seconds) into the terminal that adjust the time display at start up.


## What is done with this project...

This repository was created for the assignment and not maintained beyond the deadline.  


## What you can do with it..,

Please enjoy the contents of this project as brief demonstration of some C++ and software design concepts, but it was merely developed for a learning experience.  
  
Please consider this repo a demonstration of my ability to write in C++.
